# Wireframing reflection on article

I thought that the wireframing article was very interesting because I'm familiar with the fact that UX designers often wireframe, but the article gave me more clarity on why.

I think the steps that they outlined were very important, especially the first one - clarifying the problem. Understanding the context around a problem is very helpful in informing the direction of a design, especially to get you and other stakeholders on the same page. I also thing that wireframing is very important in considering different states, like error states or certain less-common flows.

That being said, I do think that there is some redundancy in making wireframe sketches and translating them into wireframes on the computer. The idea of a high-fidelity wireframe, especially in this day and age, seems a bit overkill since it's so quick to go into high-fidelity with design systems and UI kits. Overall, this article has taught me how important it is to wireframe and the ways to do so effectively.
